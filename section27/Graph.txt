consist in a set of nodes connected via edges

TERMINOLOGY
vertices: are the nodes of the graphs
edge: line that connect pairs of vertices
unweighted graph: the edges does not have values
weighted graph: the edges have values
undirected graph: the edges does not have a direction
directed graph: edges have a direction associated with them
ciclyc graph: graph that have a loop
aciclyc graph: graph with no loop
tree: the graph is unideracitonal and aciclyc

TYPES
directed:
    -weighted:
        positive:the edges are positive and directed
        negative:the weight of the edges are negative
    -unweighted:there is direction in the edges

undirected:
    -weighted:
        positive:the edges are positive with no direction
        negative:the weight of the edges are negative
    -unweighted:there is no weight and the edges are undirected


RAPPRESENTATION OF GRAPHS 
adjacency matrix:2d array that rappresent the edges of the graph for each pair of vertices
adjacency list: collection of unordered linked list, in which each list reppresent the set of neighbors that each vertices have
