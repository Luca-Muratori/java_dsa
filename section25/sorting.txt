SORTING
arrangin data in a particular format: ascending or descending

TYPES OF SORTING 
based on the space that is used we can subdivide the sorting in:
in place:do not require extra space for sorting
out of place: require extra space for sorting

based on the stability:
stable: similar elements after the sorting don't change the sequence in which they appear
unstable: similar elements after the sorting change the sequence in which they appear

TERMINOLOGY
incrising order:if successive element is greater than the previous one;
decreasing order: successive element is less then the previous one;
non increasing order:successive element is less or equal then the previous one;
non decreasing order:successive element is greater or equal then the previous one;

BUBBLE SORT
we compare each pair of adjacent items and swap them if they are in the wrong order, repeatedly
use: input is almost sorted, space is a concernce, easy to implement
avoid:time complexity is to big
