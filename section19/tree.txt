TREE
nonlinear data structure with hierarchial relationship between its elements
without having any cicle

Propierties
-represent hierarchial data
-each node have two components:
    data and link to its subcategory
-base category and sub categories under it

Why we need it?
-quicker and esier access to the data
-store hierarchial data, like folder structure

Tree terminology
-root: node that doesn't have a parent (n1)
-edge: link between parent and child (n1---edge--->n2)
-leaf:node that doesn't have any children
-sibling:childrens of the same parents
-ancestor:parent, greatparent or great-greatparent ecc. of a node
-depth of node: lenght of the path from root to a given node
-height of node: lenght of the past from the node to the deepest node
-depth of tree: depth of root node
-height of tree: height of root node
