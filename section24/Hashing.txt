what is hashing
method of sorting and indexing data
allow large amounts of data to be indexed usng keys commonly created by formulas

why
it's time efficient in case of search operation

terminology
hash function:function that can map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size
key: input data given by the user
hash value (or value): value returned by hash function

key-->hash function-->hash value

hash table: data structure that can map keys to value

collision: 2 output produce the same value

propierties
-distributed hash values accordingly in the hash tables(not cause collision)
-it use all inputs data

COLLISION RESOLUTION TECHNIQUES
two types:
-direct chaining
    in the hash table we insert the location of the first key, and value with the same hash value will be added as linked list from this first elemtn
-open addressing
    the value are stored in other vacant buckets, during storage and lookup these value are found using the probing
    -linear probing: it places new key into closest following empty cell
    -quadratic probing:adding quadratic polynomial to the index until an empty cell is found;
    -double hashing:intervall between probes is computed by another hash function


PROS AND CONS 
direct chaining=hash table never get full---huge linked list cause performance leaks
open addressing=easy implementation---creating a new hash table affect performance

if input sie is known we use open addressing

using delition frequently better direct chaining

PRACTICAL USE 
used in password storage
used in file sistem




hashing vs other ds 
insertion-deletion and search take o 1 , but when is not good implemented it take o n
