BINAERY HEAP
is a binary tree with the following propierties:
-the node at the root must be among all keys present in the binary HEAP
-it's a complete tree, with all the levels filled, except for the last ones, that they still have the last nodes as left as possible

why we need it?
to make sure that the tc of inserting and searching is log n

type of binary HEAP
min heap=the value of the children is greater then the parents
max heap=the value of each node is more or equal than the value of the parents
